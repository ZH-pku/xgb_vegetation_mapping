Summary and Instructions

This directory is about computing the distance to waterbody. Please make sure that the 'scikit-fmm' and 'gdal' package has been correctly installed. The fresh water mask and coastline mask of New Zealand could be found in 'data' folder, as an example of this demo. Before computing, please change the 'root' directory in each 'main_calcWaterDist.py' file to the current folder.
