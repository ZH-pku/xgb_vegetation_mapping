# XGBoost Vegetation Mapping Program
Accurate mapping of vegetation is a premise for conserving, managing, and sustainably using vegetation resources, especially at conditions of intensive human activities and accelerating global changes. However, it is still challenging today to produce high-resolution multiclass vegetation map in high accuracy, due to the incapacity of traditional mapping technology in distinguishing mosaic vegetation classes with subtle differences and the paucity of fieldwork data. This study, using extensive features and abundant vegetation survey data, created a workflow by adopting a promising classifier, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to produce accurate vegetation maps of two strikingly different cases: Dzungarian Basin in China and New Zealand. For Dzungarian Basin, a vegetation map with 7 vegetation types, 17 subtypes, and 43 associations was produced, with an overall accuracy of 0.907, 0.801, and 0.748, respectively. For New Zealand, a map of 10 habitats and a map of 41 vegetation classes were produced, at an overall accuracy of 0.946, 0.703, respectively. The workflow incorporating simplified field survey procedures outperformed conventional field surveying and remote sensing based methods in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. Besides, it opens the possibility of building large-scale, high-resolution, and timely vegetation monitoring platforms for most terrestrial ecosystems worldwide with the aid of Google Earth Engine and citizen science programs.
